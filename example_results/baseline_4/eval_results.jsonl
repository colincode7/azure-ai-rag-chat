Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted   Providers   Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for out-of-network or non-contracted providers;   however, it is not as comprehensive as the coverage provided for in-network services.   When you seek care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay more for   services than you would if you had used an in-network option.   When seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to know exactly what   services are covered and what you will be expected to pay out of pocket. Generally, out-of-    network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted   providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher.   It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not   count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: Standard plan. This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are   protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers.   What is balance billing?    Balance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and   what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars   and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance   billing when visiting in-network providers.   What is an in-network provider?   In-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that   have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan’s payment terms. Visiting an in-network   provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network   providers on the Northwind Health website.   What if I visit an out-of-network provider?    Visiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing.   Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network   providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and   what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in-  network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.   Tips to avoid balance billing:    • Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.      • Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any   services.    • Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network.    • Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time.    • If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance   company to negotiate a lower cost.   Exceptions to the balance billing protection:    • Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.    • Balance billing protection does not apply to mental health and substance abuse coverage.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: For example, if   your provider’s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the   remaining $100 balance billing amount.   Exceptions   There are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan   may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain   services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating   providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating   providers’ charges if there are no participating providers in your area.   Tips   In order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your   provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are   unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.      It is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find   out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill   you after the health plan pays them.   When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating   providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some   providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.   Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check   with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service.   Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about   the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.

Calendar Year Deductible   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible     The Northwind Standard plan has a calendar year deductible of $2,000 for each individual   and $4,000 for each family. A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for   health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most   services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists,   hospitals, and pharmacies.    However, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as   immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally,   prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per   individual and $500 per family.    It is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means   that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: insurance begins   to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not   be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.    Tips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible   Meeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few   steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.    First, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These   services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible   without paying out of pocket.    Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large   network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are   not paying more than you have to for services.    Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings   account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are   tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical   costs.    Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers   offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of   money you need to pay out of pocket.    By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take   advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.   Coinsurance   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance   Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your   deductible.

Calendar Year Deductible   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible     The Northwind Standard plan has a calendar year deductible of $2,000 for each individual   and $4,000 for each family. A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for   health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most   services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists,   hospitals, and pharmacies.    However, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as   immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally,   prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per   individual and $500 per family.    It is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means   that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: insurance begins   to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not   be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.    Tips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible   Meeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few   steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.    First, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These   services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible   without paying out of pocket.    Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large   network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are   not paying more than you have to for services.    Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings   account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are   tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical   costs.    Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers   offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of   money you need to pay out of pocket.    By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take   advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.   Coinsurance   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance   Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your   deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For     example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the   service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.    Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some   exceptions.","latency":1.793637,"groundedness_score":5,"groundedness_reason":"The answer is directly supported by the context provided in the Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf, which states that the plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of-network services.","relevance_score":5,"relevance_reason":"The answer perfectly addresses the main aspects of the question.

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS    When it comes to health insurance, many people are unaware of the different factors that   impact the costs they pay. One of the most significant components that affects your costs is   the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network     providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure   you’re getting the best value for your health care services, it’s important to understand how   providers can affect your costs.    In-Network Providers    Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your   Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on   services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When   selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for   services, often referred to as a “co-pay” or “co-insurance”. It’s important to note that   different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it’s best to   contact your provider to understand what the cost will be.    Out-of-Network Providers\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: some   exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally,   coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%.   It’s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by   the plan’s copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for   paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally,   Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services.   When you receive services, it’s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure   you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It’s also important to be aware of the coinsurance   rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-of-  network services.   It’s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed   amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what   is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the   actual cost.    If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard   will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need   services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.   Finally, it’s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket   maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of-  pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket   for services.   In summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is   typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It’s important   to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it’s worth the cost to   pay more for out-of-network services.

First, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These   services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible   without paying out of pocket.    Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large   network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are   not paying more than you have to for services.    Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings   account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are   tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical   costs.    Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers   offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of   money you need to pay out of pocket.    By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take   advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.   Coinsurance   IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance   Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your   deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For     example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the   service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.    Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some   exceptions.","latency":2.08224,"groundedness_score":5,"groundedness_reason":"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context.

Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By   following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is   convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan.   Continuity of Care   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE   At Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a   quality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind   Standard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services.   We also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all   your health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care.   Continuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to   develop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in   your health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind   Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping   you to receive the best possible care.   Continuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the   same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to   provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won’t   need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you’ve already had done.   There are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may   need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as   surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your   insurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company   and\/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: their coverage:   • Schedule regular hearing tests and evaluations.

The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays   second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its   allowed amount for the services you received.

Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage   CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage   The Northwind Health Plus plan includes a care management system that requires prior-  authorization for certain services to ensure that the plan is covering only medically   necessary care. Prior-authorization is a process used by the insurance company to review a   request for a specific service to ensure that it is medically necessary and meets the criteria   set by the plan. This process helps to ensure that members are receiving the best care\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: the best care   possible and that their benefits are used in the most cost-effective manner.    In order to receive prior-authorization, members must provide their Northwind Health Plus   provider with the necessary clinical information regarding their diagnosis and treatment   plan. The provider then submits this information to Northwind Health Plus for review.   Northwind Health Plus will then contact the provider with the decision on the prior-  authorization request.    Prior-authorization is required for certain services, including but not limited to:    • Inpatient Hospitalizations   • Outpatient Surgery   • Durable Medical Equipment   • Certain Imaging Services   • Certain Lab Tests   • Certain Physical and Occupational Therapy Services   • Certain Prescription Drugs   • Certain Home Health Services     It is important to note that some services do not require prior-authorization, as they are   considered non-medically necessary. In addition, some services may only require prior-  authorization for certain members, such as those with high-risk conditions. The Northwind   Health Plus plan has a list of services that require prior-authorization, which is available on   the Northwind Health Plus website.    There are certain exceptions to prior-authorization requirements. For example, if a member   requires emergency services, prior-authorization is not required. In addition, certain   pediatric services are exempt from prior-authorization.    It is important for members to understand that prior-authorization does not guarantee   coverage. The prior-authorization process is used to determine if a service is medically   necessary and meets the criteria set by the plan. If a service is not medically necessary or   does not meet the criteria set by the plan, the service may be denied.

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   If you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another   employer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating   benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination   helps to ensure that you don’t pay more than you should for your health care.   When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the   first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays   second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its   allowed amount for the services you received.

At Contoso, we want to make sure our employees are provided with the best coverage   options. That’s why we’ve partnered with Northwind Health to offer the Northwind   Standard plan, which provides balance billing protection when visiting in-network   providers. We encourage our employees to use the tips provided to help reduce the risk of   unexpected costs when visiting a provider.   Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted   Providers   One of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is   understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When   you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally   cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an   out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.   Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you   will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best   value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between   in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.    In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to   provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the   amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the   cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer   additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.     Out-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with   Northwind Health.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: coverage. If you   have any additional questions about in-network and non-participating providers, please   contact the Northwind Health Plus customer service line.   Balance Billing Protection   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Balance Billing Protection   Balance billing is a practice where a provider bills you for the difference between the   allowed amount and billed amount. The allowed amount is the amount that your insurance   company determines is a reasonable fee for a service. The amount you are billed for is the   amount that the provider charges you for the services. With Northwind Health Plus, you are   protected from balance billing. This means that you can rest assured that you will not be   billed more than the allowed amount by your provider.    Balance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus. This protection   ensures that you will not be responsible for the difference between the allowed amount and   the billed amount. This protection helps you to avoid unexpected costs.    Exceptions:     Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers. If you receive   services from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the difference   between the allowed amount and the billed amount.    Balance billing protection also does not apply to certain services, such as cosmetic services   and experimental procedures. If you are considering receiving any of these services, it is   important to check with Northwind Health Plus to determine whether balance billing   protection applies.   Tips:   1. Get preauthorization: When you are planning to receive a service, it is important to get   preauthorization. Preauthorization will help you to determine if the service is covered and   the amount that you will be responsible for.    2. Ask questions: Ask your provider questions about the services they are providing and the   cost of the services. This will help you to understand the costs associated with the services\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: For example, if   your provider’s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the   remaining $100 balance billing amount.   Exceptions   There are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan   may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain   services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating   providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating   providers’ charges if there are no participating providers in your area.   Tips   In order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your   provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are   unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.      It is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find   out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill   you after the health plan pays them.   When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating   providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some   providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.   Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check   with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service.   Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about   the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.

Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted   Providers   Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for out-of-network or non-contracted providers;   however, it is not as comprehensive as the coverage provided for in-network services.   When you seek care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay more for   services than you would if you had used an in-network option.   When seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to know exactly what   services are covered and what you will be expected to pay out of pocket. Generally, out-of-    network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted   providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher.   It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not   count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum.

This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are   protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers.   What is balance billing?    Balance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and   what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars   and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance   billing when visiting in-network providers.   What is an in-network provider?   In-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that   have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan’s payment terms. Visiting an in-network   provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network   providers on the Northwind Health website.   What if I visit an out-of-network provider?    Visiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing.   Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network   providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and   what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in-  network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.   Tips to avoid balance billing:    • Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.      • Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any   services.    • Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network.    • Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time.    • If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance   company to negotiate a lower cost.   Exceptions to the balance billing protection:    • Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.    • Balance billing protection does not apply to mental health and substance abuse coverage.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: For example, if   your provider’s charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the   remaining $100 balance billing amount.   Exceptions   There are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan   may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain   services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating   providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating   providers’ charges if there are no participating providers in your area.   Tips   In order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your   provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are   unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.      It is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find   out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill   you after the health plan pays them.   When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating   providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some   providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.   Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check   with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service.   Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about   the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.

Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted   Providers   One of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is   understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When   you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally   cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an   out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.   Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you   will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best   value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between   in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.    In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to   provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the   amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the   cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer   additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.     Out-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with   Northwind Health.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf: coverage.

The amount you are billed for is the   amount that the provider charges you for the services. With Northwind Health Plus, you are   protected from balance billing. This means that you can rest assured that you will not be   billed more than the allowed amount by your provider.    Balance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus. This protection   ensures that you will not be responsible for the difference between the allowed amount and   the billed amount. This protection helps you to avoid unexpected costs.    Exceptions:     Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers. If you receive   services from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the difference   between the allowed amount and the billed amount.    Balance billing protection also does not apply to certain services, such as cosmetic services   and experimental procedures. If you are considering receiving any of these services, it is   important to check with Northwind Health Plus to determine whether balance billing   protection applies.   Tips:   1.

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS   In-Network Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS   When selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the   network of in-network providers that are available with the plan.    Northwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary   care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider   that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.    When you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower   copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many   services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an   in-network provider.    It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for   emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network     services. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive   them from an out-of-network provider.    When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make   sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by   calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind   Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to   make sure your provider is in-network.    Second, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers   may be in-network but not be taking new patients.    Third, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be   difficult for you to get to your appointments.    Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to   find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: weekend hours.    Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By   following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is   convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan.   Continuity of Care   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE   At Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a   quality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind   Standard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services.   We also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all   your health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care.   Continuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to   develop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in   your health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind   Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping   you to receive the best possible care.   Continuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the   same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to   provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won’t   need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you’ve already had done.   There are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may   need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as   surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your   insurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company   and\/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs.","latency":3.456964,"groundedness_score":5,"groundedness_reason":"The answer accurately and comprehensively reflects the information provided in the context.

Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: plan benefits.   It's important to remember that Northwind Standard does not coordinate benefits with   other coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment   made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. If a provider has   been paid by another plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind   Standard pays its portion of the claim.   If you have other coverage, it's important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure   you are taking full advantage of your coverage. If you need help understanding your plan   benefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits, please contact the   Northwind Standard Plan Customer Service team. We're here to help!   Primary And Secondary Rules   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   If you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse’s plan, Northwind   Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will   pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.   The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to   understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and   the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying   the largest portion of your healthcare costs.   For example, if you have a spouse’s health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse’s plan   would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This   means that your spouse’s plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and   Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.   It’s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not   covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses     that exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000","latency":2.446517,"groundedness_score":5,"groundedness_reason":"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context.

Hospital   COVERED SERVICES: Hospitals   Northwind Health Plus provides coverage for hospital services, both in-network and out-of-  network.

Copayments are a fixed   dollar amount that you’re responsible for paying, while coinsurance is a percentage of the   total cost of the services.

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS   When it comes to healthcare, one of the most important decisions you can make is choosing   the right provider. With Northwind Health Plus, you can select from a wide range of in-  network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and   pharmacies. This plan also covers emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.     The provider you choose will have a direct impact on your costs. When you use in-network   providers, you’ll pay lower out-of-pocket costs. On the other hand, if you use out-of-network   providers, you’ll be responsible for a larger portion of the cost. In some cases, you may be   responsible for the entire cost.    It is important to note that in-network providers are not necessarily the same across all   plans. So, even if a provider is in-network for one plan, they may not be in-network for   another. Therefore, it’s important to check if your preferred provider is in-network before   you select a plan.    When selecting a provider, there are a few tips you should keep in mind:    • Research your provider’s credentials.

Prior authorization is a process in which Northwind Health reviews your request for   coverage and decides whether or not it will cover the care that you have requested. To be   approved for prior authorization, you must meet certain criteria and provide certain   information. This criteria and information may vary depending on the type of care you are   requesting.    Prior authorization requests must be submitted to Northwind Health by your provider. In   most cases, your provider will submit the request for you. Northwind Health will then   review the request and make a decision about whether or not it will cover the care.      In some cases, Northwind Health may approve the request for coverage, but with certain   limitations or conditions. For example, Northwind Health may limit the number of visits for   a specific procedure or limit the amount of coverage for a specific procedure. It is important   to understand any limitations or conditions that Northwind Health places on the prior   authorization before you receive care from an out-of-network provider.    It is also important to understand that certain services may not require prior authorization.   For example, emergency services and certain preventive services may not require prior   authorization.    Tips for Employees:    1.

This includes a complete medical history and diagnosis, as well   as any other relevant information. Northwind Health may also request additional   information or tests to make a decision.   When requesting prior authorization, it is important to plan ahead. Northwind Health must   receive all the necessary information before the requested service is provided. If Northwind   Health does not receive all the necessary information, the prior authorization request may   be denied.   When requesting prior authorization, it is also important to check with your doctor to make   sure the service is covered under Northwind Standard. Some services may not be covered,   even if prior authorization is approved.   Finally, if the service is approved, make sure to keep a copy of the authorization. This will   help ensure that you receive the coverage you are entitled to.   Prior authorization can be a complicated process.

COB's Effect On Benefits   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? - COB's Effect On Benefits   When you have more than one health insurance policy, the policies coordinate benefits   through a process called Coordination of Benefits (COB). Coordination of Benefits is a   process that helps to determine which plan pays first when there are multiple health plans     available. This process is important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket   for care.   When Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first),   any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays   benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health   Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.   The amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of   the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service. Northwind Health Plus may   pay up to the amount of the maximum allowable charge, which is the maximum amount the   plan pays for a service.   If you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the   other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which   plan is primary and which is secondary.   When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus   insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the   benefits correctly.   When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus   insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the   benefits correctly.

For instance, if you have   Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind   Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for   prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D   will be the secondary coverage.   It’s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to   provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as “creditable   coverage,” and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses   once the primary plan has paid.   When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it’s important to remember   that each health plan is different. Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the   specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage.

COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   At Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of   Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage.   COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more   than one health plan.   When an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined   by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays     first, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a   Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.   Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the   network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost.   However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind   Standard network will not be covered by the plan.   When you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the   provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that   you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health   coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.   When you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about   the other coverage you have. If the claim is sent to Northwind Standard before any other   plan, the claim will be processed based on the Northwind Standard plan benefits.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: will pay   first; the secondary plan will pay what the primary plan does not.

If you fail to do so, you may be   responsible for any charges that Northwind Health would have paid if you had notified   them of the other coverage.   In certain circumstances, you may be able to keep your other coverage and still be eligible   for coverage under the Northwind Standard plan. However, if the other coverage is primary,   you will be responsible for any charges that would have been paid by the Northwind   Standard plan.   It is also important to note that if you have coverage through a government-sponsored   program such as Medicare or Medicaid, you may be subject to certain restrictions. For   example, you may be required to obtain certain services through the government-  sponsored plan.   Tips for Employees   To ensure you get the most out of your Northwind Standard coverage, here are some tips:   • Make sure you understand the terms and conditions of your other coverage and any   restrictions associated with it.   • Know which plan is primary and which is secondary.   • Notify Northwind Health of any changes in your coverage status or any changes in any of   your other coverage.   • Understand any restrictions associated with any government-sponsored programs you   may be enrolled in.    • Your Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain services, such as emergency care,   mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services. Be sure to explore   alternative coverage options if you need coverage for these services.   • Take advantage of preventive care services and prescription drug coverage available   through your Northwind Standard plan.   • Make sure you understand your plan’s coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses   you may be responsible for.","latency":2.1975,"groundedness_score":5,"groundedness_reason":"The answer logically follows from the information provided in the context.

By understanding how to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus and other health   care plans, you can make sure that you are getting the most out of your health care   coverage.    COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   The term “Other Coverage” is defined as any other insurance, health plan, or other coverage   which provides benefits and services for medical care that is also provided under the   Northwind Health Plus plan. This includes, but is not limited to, Medicare, TRICARE,   Medicaid, employer-sponsored plans, and government-sponsored plans.   When you have Other Coverage, Northwind Health Plus follows something called   “Coordination of Benefits” (COB). This means that Northwind Health Plus coordinates its   benefits with the Other Coverage in order to ensure that you receive the maximum amount   of benefits available to you. Northwind Health Plus will pay benefits only after the Other   Coverage pays its benefits.     To understand how COB works, it is important to understand the following terms:   • Primary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits first.   • Secondary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits after the Primary Coverage   has paid out its benefits.   • Crossover Claims: These are claims that are submitted to both the Primary Coverage and   the Secondary Coverage at the same time.   In order for Northwind Health Plus to serve as the Secondary Coverage, you must provide\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: first, even if   the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is   required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind   Standard may pay first.   Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits   When COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible   expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of   service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the   secondary payer may pay nothing.     For example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the   secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer   pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.   Tips for Working with COB   When you have multiple health insurance plans, it’s important to understand how COB   works and how it can affect your benefits. Here are a few tips to help you manage your   benefits:   • Make sure that each insurance company has all of the necessary information about your   other coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.   • Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each   other.   • Ask your health care providers to submit claims to both insurance companies.   • Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits.   • If you have questions, contact each insurance company for clarification.

COB Definitions   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   At Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of   Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage.   COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more   than one health plan.   When an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined   by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays     first, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a   Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.   Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the   network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost.   However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind   Standard network will not be covered by the plan.   When you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the   provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that   you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health   coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.   When you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about   the other coverage you have.

Intentionally False Or Misleading Statements   OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN      Intentionally False Or Misleading Statements:    When it comes to health insurance, there are unfortunately many companies who make   intentionally false or misleading statements about their plans. Northwind Health is no   exception. It is important for employees to be aware of any potential inaccuracies or false   information that Northwind Health may use when discussing their plans.   First and foremost, it is important to remember that Northwind Standard does not offer   coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-  network services. The Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for medical, vision, and   dental services, but does not cover any of the services mentioned.

It's important to remember that Northwind Standard does not coordinate benefits with   other coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment   made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. If a provider has   been paid by another plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind   Standard pays its portion of the claim.   If you have other coverage, it's important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure   you are taking full advantage of your coverage.

Primary And Secondary Rules   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   If you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse’s plan, Northwind   Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will   pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.   The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to   understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and   the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying   the largest portion of your healthcare costs.   For example, if you have a spouse’s health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse’s plan   would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This   means that your spouse’s plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and   Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.   It’s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not   covered by the primary plan.

Many doctors are willing to work with you   to find the most cost-effective treatment options available.    • Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully.

Member Cooperation   MEMBER COOPERATION   At Northwind Health, we understand that people are more likely to get the care they need   when they are informed and empowered with the knowledge they need. That is why we   have included the following information in our Northwind Standard plan to help inform and   empower our members.    When you sign up for the Northwind Standard plan, you are agreeing to certain   responsibilities as a member of the plan. This includes being aware of the plan’s benefits   and limitations, as well as your obligations under the plan.    Covering Your Expenses   When you are enrolled in Northwind Standard, your plan will cover a portion of your   medical and vision expenses.

Seeking Pre-Approval for Care\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: plan benefits.   It's important to remember that Northwind Standard does not coordinate benefits with   other coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment   made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. If a provider has   been paid by another plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind   Standard pays its portion of the claim.   If you have other coverage, it's important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure   you are taking full advantage of your coverage. If you need help understanding your plan   benefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits, please contact the   Northwind Standard Plan Customer Service team. We're here to help!   Primary And Secondary Rules   WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?   If you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse’s plan, Northwind   Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will   pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.   The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to   understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and   the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying   the largest portion of your healthcare costs.   For example, if you have a spouse’s health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse’s plan   would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This   means that your spouse’s plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and   Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.   It’s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not   covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses     that exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000","latency":2.855557,"groundedness_score":5,"groundedness_reason":"The answer accurately and comprehensively lists all the expenses a member might be responsible for under the Northwind Standard plan, as detailed in the context.

It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for   emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network     services. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive   them from an out-of-network provider.    When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make   sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by   calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind   Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to   make sure your provider is in-network.    Second, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers   may be in-network but not be taking new patients.    Third, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be   difficult for you to get to your appointments.    Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to   find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: weekend hours.    Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By   following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is   convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan.   Continuity of Care   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE   At Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a   quality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind   Standard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services.   We also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all   your health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care.   Continuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to   develop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in   your health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind   Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping   you to receive the best possible care.   Continuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the   same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to   provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won’t   need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you’ve already had done.   There are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may   need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as   surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your   insurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company   and\/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: Northwind Health.
