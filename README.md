# Evaluating the chat app answers

There are many parameters that affect the quality and style of the answers generated by the chat app,
such as the system prompt, the search service parameters, and the GPT model parameters.

Whenever you are making changes with the goal of improving the answers, we recommend evaluating the results.
We provide a script and tools to make it easier to evaluate any changes, and we also provide examples of evaluations we've run on potential changes in the past.

## Deploying a GPT-4 model

We recommend using GPT-4 for performing the evaluation, even if your chat app uses GPT-3.5 or another model.
You can either use an Azure OpenAI instance or an openai.com instance.

### Using a new Azure OpenAI instance

To use a new Azure OpenAI instance, you'll need to create a new instance and deploy the app to it.
We've made that easy to deploy with the `azd` CLI tool.

1. Install the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
2. Run `azd auth login` to log in to your Azure account
3. Run `azd up` to deploy a new GPT-4 instance

### Using an existing Azure OpenAI instance

If you already have an Azure OpenAI instance, you can use that instead of creating a new one.

1. Create `.env` file by copying `.env.sample`
2. Fill in the values for your instance:

    ```shell
    AZURE_OPENAI_EVAL_DEPLOYMENT="<deployment-name>"
    AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE="<service-name>"
    ```
3. The scripts default to keyless access (via `AzureDefaultCredential`), but you can optionally use a key by setting `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` in `.env`.

### Using an openai.com instance

If you have an openai.com instance, you can use that instead of an Azure OpenAI instance.

1. Create `.env` file by copying `.env.sample`
2. Fill in the values for your OpenAI account. You might not have an organization, in which case you can leave that blank.

    ```shell
    OPENAICOM_API_KEY=""
    OPENAICOM_ORGANIZATION=""
    ```


## Setting up ground truth data

In order to evaluate new answers, we need to compare them to "ground truth" answers: what we consider to be ideal answers for a particular question. We recommend at least 200 QA pairs if possible.

There are a few ways to get this data:

1. Manually curate a set of questions and answers that you consider to be ideal. This is the most accurate, but also the most time-consuming. Make sure your answers include citations in the expected format. This approach requires domain expertise in the data.
2. Use the generator script to generate a set of questions and answers. This is the fastest, but may also be the least accurate. You can call the script like this:

    ```shell
    python3 -m scripts generate --output=example_input/qa.jsonl --numquestions=200 --persource=5
    ```

    That script will generate 200 questions and answers, and store them in `evaluator/qa.jsonl`. We've already provided an example based off the sample documents for this app.

3. Use the generator script to generate a set of questions and answers, and then manually curate them, rewriting any answers that are subpar and adding missing citations. This is a good middle ground, and is what we recommend.

## Running an evaluation

We provide a script that loads in the current `azd` environment's variables, installs the requirements for the evaluation, and runs the evaluation against the local app. Run it like this:

```shell
python3 -m scripts evaluate --config=example_config.json --numquestions=2
```

The config.json should contain these fields as a minimum:

```json
{
    "testdata_path": "example_input/qa.jsonl",
    "target_url": "http://localhost:50505/chat",
    "results_dir": "example_results/experiment<TIMESTAMP>"
}
```

### Running against a local container

If you're running this evaluator in a container and your app is running in a container on the same system, use a URL like this for the `target_url`:

"target_url": "http://host.docker.internal:50505/chat"

### Running against a deployed app

To run against a deployed endpoint, change the `target_url` to the chat endpoint of the deployed app:

"target_url": "https://app-backend-j25rgqsibtmlo.azurewebsites.net/chat"

### Running on a subset of questions

It's common to run the evaluation on a subset of the questions, to get a quick sense of how the changes are affecting the answers. To do this, use the `--numquestions` parameter:

```shell
python3 -m scripts evaluate --config=example_config.json --numquestions=2
```

### Sending additional parameters to the app

This repo assumes that your chat app is following the [Chat App Protocol](TODO), which means that all POST requests look like this:

```json
{"messages": [{"content": "<Actual user question goes here>", "role": "user"}],
 "stream": False,
 "context": {...},
}
```

Any additional app parameters would be specified in the `context` of that JSON, such as temperature, search settings, prompt overrides, etc. To specify those parameters, add a `target_parameters` key to your config JSON:

```json
    "target_parameters": {
        "overrides": {
            "semantic_ranker": false,
            "retrieval_mode": "hybrid",
            "semantic_captions": false,
            "top": 3,
            "suggest_followup_questions": false,
            "prompt_template": "<READFILE>example_input/prompt_chris.txt"
        }
    }
```

The `overrides` key is the same as the `overrides` key in the `context` of the POST request.
As a convenience, you can use the `<READFILE>` prefix to read in a file and use its contents as the value for the parameter.
That way, you can store potential (long) prompts separately from the config JSON file.

## Viewing the results

The results of each evaluation are stored in a results folder (defaulting to `example_results`).
Inside each run's folder, you'll find:

- `eval_results.jsonl`: Each question and answer, along with the GPT metrics for each QA pair.
- `parameters.json`: The parameters used for the run, like the overrides.
- `summary.json`: The overall results, like the average GPT metrics.
- `config.json`: The original config used for the run. This is useful for reproducing the run.

To make it easier to view and compare results across runs, we've built a few tools,
located inside the `review-tools` folder.

### Using the summary tool

To view a summary across all the runs, use the `summary` command with the path to the results folder:

```bash
python3 -m review_tools summary example_results
```

This will display an interactive table with the results for each run, like this:

![Screenshot of CLI tool with table of results](docs/screenshot_summary.png)

To see the parameters used for a particular run, select the folder name.
A modal will appear with the parameters, including any prompt override.

### Using the compare tool

To compare the answers generated for each question across 2 runs, use the `compare` command with 2 paths:

```bash
python3 -m review_tools diff example_results/baseline_1 example_results/baseline_2
```

This will display each question, one at a time, with the two generated answers in scrollable panes,
and the GPT metrics below each answer.

Use the buttons at the bottom to navigate to the next question or quit the tool.
